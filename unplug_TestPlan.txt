Test Items :
1. Full Voltage Value: DONE
	Test : a) Charge the full battery more than 4.15 Value : B1F8 = 4.17V
		   b) Check the BQ charging Status Pin went OFF at the full charge battery : 4.17V

2. ACR value at Full Voltage 
	Test : by charging at 4.15v to discharging at 3v.
		   a) Take Initial ACR value 0x400 and charge the battery at 4.15V. At 4.15v check the battery ACR value. And change the value to 0xFFFF.
		   b) After that discharge the battery till 3v and measure the battery ACR value.
		   c) By differentiating the (FFFF - ACR at 3v) get the ACR value.
		   
		working on this 3. ACR value at Low Voltage
			Test : At the time of discharging measure the ACR value at 3v.

4. Generate the Log file at Full charging mode : DONE
	Test : After getting ACR value change it and put battery into full charge mode.

		5. Generate the log file at Full discharging mode
			Test : After Full charge the battery put battery into discharge mode.

6. Check the LED Status at the <0.07% Battery
	Test : a) At the Full battery Discharge time.
		   b) Put the ACR Initial value in between ACR Threshold limit and discharge the battery.

7. Check the LED Glow status at every Stage : DONE
	Test : a) Check at the time of charging and discharging mode.

8. Read battery ACR status at every 1% Charge
	Test : a) Dump the code with disable Switch INTR only Power Good (Charging Port) on and read the ACR and voltage value at every 1% Charging Condition.
		   b) Dump the code with disable Switch INTR only Charging port on and read the ACR and voltage value at every 1% Discharging Condition.
